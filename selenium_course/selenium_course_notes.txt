-> Any pytest file should start with test_
-> pytest method names should start with test
-> Any code should be wrapped in method only
-> Method name should have sens
-> -k stands for method names execution
-> -s logs in out put
-> -v stands for more inform metadata
-> Execute project:
    py.test -v -s
    py.test <test_file_name> -v -s
    py.test -k <regular_expression> -v -s    <---To execute scenarios that match the regular expression
    py.test --html=report.html  <-- To generate html reports for execution
    py.test -m <mark_name> -v -s
        ->mark example: @pytest.mark.smoke   <---Write above beggining of the function
                        @pytest.mark.skip    <---Skip scenario
                        @pytest.mark.xfail   <---Not execute nor report.
->  fixtures are used as setup and tear down methods for test cases- conftest files to generalize
                fixture and make it available to all test cases.
-> Data driven and parameterization can be done with return statements in tuple format --> see conftest.py LoadData
                fixture and execute test_demoing_pytest.py
-> Run jenkins:
         java -jar jenkins.war
