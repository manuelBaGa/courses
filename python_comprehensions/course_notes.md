    <summary>1. Zen of python </summary>

    -   Beautiful is better than ugly.
    -   Explicit is better than implicit.
    -   Simple is better than complex.
    -   Complex is better than complicated.
    -   Flat is better than nested.
    -   Sparse is better than dense.
    -   Readability counts.
    -   Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    -   Although practicality beats purity.
    -   Errors should never pass silently.
    -   Unless explicitly silenced.
    -   In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    -   There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    -   Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    -   Now is better than never.
    -   Although never is often better than *right* now.
    -   If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    -   If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    -   Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

<summary>2. Sets </summary>

    1. Doesn't allow duplicated elements
    2. Popular methods: add, update, remove, discard, clear.
        - Discard is similar to remove but if the element to discard doesn't exist the code doesn't return an error.
    3. Main operations (equivalent operator): union ("|"), intersection ("&"), difference ("-"), symmetric difference ("^")
        - symmetric difference: join between elements that are not shared across sets.

<summary>3. Comprehension </summary>

### 3.1 List Comprehensions
    1. General structure: [ <element> for <element> in <iterable> ]
    2. Conditional sintaxys: [ <element> for <element> in <iterable> if <conditional>]

### 3.2 Dictionary Comprehensions
    1. General structure: { key : value for var in iterable }
    2. Conditional sintaxys: { key : value for var in iterable if condition }
    - zip function join elements from two list based on index
